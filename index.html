            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>With over 10 years of experience in Counterparty Credit Risk within the UK Financial Services sector (Glasgow and London), I bring extensive expertise in CCR, CRD IV and Basel regulations, along with deep familiarity with credit risk metrics like RWAs, PFE, and others across diverse asset classes and financial instruments, particularly derivatives and SFTs (repos and securities lending). More recently, I have been working as a Data Analytics and BI Manager for a FinTech company in Paphos, Cyprus, where my role involves managing large datasets with Python and SQL and visualizing insights through various Business Intelligence tools. I have also recently in my last two roles focusing on Machine Learning models that help with automation of data tasks and predictions of various scenarios.</p>
            <p>I hold a strong quantitative background with a BSc in Mathematics and an MSc in Financial Mathematics, equipping me with a solid analytical approach to problem-solving. My experience also includes a proven ability to perform under pressure and meet tight deadlines, and I am comfortable working both collaboratively and independently with minimal supervision.</p>
